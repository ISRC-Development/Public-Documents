ISRC Standard Operating Procedures

Air Assets
1) No air assets (unmanned aerial vehicles excluded) shall be operated without either 1-6 or 6 on station.
2) A forward air controller should also be in the field with a visual of the AO, in the case of CAS situations. 
3) If flying near a front-line, (< 1000m), a Phantom element should act as a forward observer to ensure no enemy AA capabilities are present.
4) Operating any air asset that is not within your respective role will result in a one-time warning, followed by permanent ban if it continues to be an issue.
5) *See exception 1*

Air Assets - CAS
1) No HE within 150 meters of any structures. Any buildings destroyed will greatly impact the public’s view of our forces HOWEVER, 6 or any other command element in charge may call for destruction of structures in the case that no civilians are present and the destruction of the building outweighs the negative impact, IE: high profile targets, imminent threat to our forces, large drug manufacturing facility etc. Some buildings have false representation and may be deceiving IE: human trafficking hub, cartel family hideout etc.. Keep this in mind.
2) Operating any air asset that is not within your respective role will result in a one-time warning, followed by permanent ban if it continues to be an issue.
3) Under the circumstance that there is no command slotted in, 1-1 may take command/JTAC roles.
4) *See exception 1*

Armor Assets
1) No armor assets shall be operated without either 1-6 or 6 on station.
2) No HE within 150 meters of any structures. (Same as Air Assets - CAS)
3) *See exception 1*

Ground Assets
2) Operating any ground asset that is not within your respective role will result in a one-time warning, followed by permanent ban if it continues to be an issue.
3) Leaving any asset in the field is not allowed and may be punishable if determined to be of reckless/careless intent. If you inadvertently disconnect then get a hold of a Bishop, they will be able to help. If you are killed in the field and your vehicle is left in a non-dangerous area, coordinate with a Keeper for a recovery. If you are killed in the field and your vehicle is left in a dangerous area, coordinate with a 1-3 for a tactical recovery as they are combat-based engineers. 

Infantry
1) Under no circumstances is team-killing allowed. This doesn’t just apply to infantry but to all roles.
2) If you are stuck at FOB and need a reinsert, DO NOT TAKE A VEHICLE unless explicitly instructed to do so by either a command element (6, 7, 8, 1-6) or a Bishop. If you can’t seem to get a ride out then try pinging Bishop, it can be frustrating and we understand that you don’t want to spend your free time hanging out at FOB.
If you can’t get a Bishop on station then try the Discord. 

Guidelines & Notes
1) Killing civilians or destroying buildings has a detrimental effect on our civ rating which increases targeted attacks on our convoys and FOB/FLP as well as our funding coefficient.
2) Team-killing won't be tolerated.
3) Purposefully ditching/destroying vehicles won't be tolerated.
4) Only Phantom/Hog can operate unmanned aerial vehicles UNLESS instructed to do so by 6.
5) Keep a good attitude and let us know how we can improve.
6) Have a good time!

Exceptions
1) *In low-pop situatiuons, ie: < 10 players, Air/armor assets MAY OPERATE without command elements slotted but ONLY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES that 1-1/1-2/1-4 SQUAD-LEADER takes responsibility and assumes a forward-air-controller role on top of their usual duties.*

Notice
By joining the server and slotting into a role, you are agreeing that you have read and understood these SOP’s to the fullest. “I didn’t know” is equal to “I don’t care” in our book and will be treated as such. We enjoy having an awesome community and want to keep it that way! - The Bishops
